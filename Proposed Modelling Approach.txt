Proposed Modelling Approach:

Split on 2021:
------------
races> 2021 are testing. 
races before 2021 are for training



Model :
------------
Features: Practice time (seconds), Gap (sec), and # of laps for each practice (For each of the three practices). 


Baseline: Choose a practice time (in the order) and that is just the grid position. (or maybe grid position is just 10?)


Models: Do softmax/cross entropy loss for Dense nn. The output of NN will be the probability that a particular driver has a particular starting grid position 

Also linear regression on the three practices variables. 

-What if we don't have the same number of drivers per race?
